### Bug ID: BUG-002
**Description:** Memory leaks detected in the event processing function.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Run the simulation for extended periods.
  2. Monitor memory usage.
  3. Notice gradual increase in memory consumption.
**Solution:** Implemented proper memory management by ensuring all dynamically allocated memory is freed.

### Bug ID: BUG-003
**Description:** Dogs are not being removed from the Reserved list upon adoption.

### Bug ID: BUG-004
**Description:** Incorrect breed displayed in the inventory after loading data.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Load data from `dogs_data.txt` containing multiple breeds.
  2. Display inventory.
  3. Notice that breeds are mismatched.
**Solution:** Corrected the data parsing logic to accurately assign breeds to each dog.


### Bug ID: BUG-005
**Description:** Simulation crashes when the Reserved list is empty.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Ensure no dogs are in the Reserved list.
  2. Trigger a reservation cancellation event.
  3. Observe program crash.
**Solution:** Added a check to ensure the Reserved list is not empty before attempting to cancel a reservation.


### Bug ID: BUG-006
**Description:** Duplicate dog entries appearing in the Adopted list.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Adopt a dog.

### Bug ID: BUG-007
**Description:** Reservation count does not decrement correctly after cancellations.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Reserve multiple dogs.
  2. Cancel some reservations.
  3. Check the reservation counts.

### Bug ID: BUG-008
**Description:** Age of dogs not displaying correctly in the inventory.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Load data with varying dog ages.
  2. Display inventory.
  3. Notice incorrect ages shown.
**Solution:** Corrected the data loading function to properly parse and assign dog ages.


### Bug ID: BUG-009
**Description:** Simulation does not terminate after the specified number of time periods.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Set simulation to run for 25 periods.
  2. Observe that it continues indefinitely.
**Solution:** Added a termination condition to end the simulation after completing the specified number of periods.


### Bug ID: BUG-010
**Description:** Inconsistent formatting in the inventory display output.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Run the simulation.
  2. Observe the inventory display.
